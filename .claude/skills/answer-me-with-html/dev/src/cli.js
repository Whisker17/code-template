- A file argument of - reads from stdin (good for heredoc: am render - <<'EOF' ... EOF).
- Output goes to ~/.answer-me-with-html/pages/ by default (change it with the AM_HOME environment variable).
- A page with STE or code warnings does not open. Fix the draft and render again with --replace <page>: the earlier page is deleted once the new one is written.
- Set auto-open, the default theme and more with am config; --open / --no-open apply to this run only.
- am patch reads the source draft from the page's hidden #am-source, changes only the ## section that --panel names, and writes the page back to the same path.
- A page with excalidraw / uml figures is baked after render and patch (needs Chrome and Node 22+; --no-bake or am config set bake off skips it).
  When baking is not possible the page still shows the figures online.`;

Intro (optional, shown below the title)

## A Panel title {span=2 meta="top-right note"}
Plain Markdown: paragraphs, lists, tables, quotes, inline code...
Write ok / no / warn in a table cell (text may follow, e.g. "ok approved") to get a ✓ / ✗ / ! badge.

\`\`\`flow LR          ← fence language = component name, followed by component arguments
A -> B
\`\`\`

\`\`\`html             ← html / svg fences are embedded as-is (escape hatch)
<div>any content</div>
\`\`\`

- "## " starts a panel; the letter ID is optional (A, B, C... are assigned automatically). span is a hint: the page sizes panels to fit their content, so wide tables and diagrams need no span. Write span only for a panel that must stand out.
- An image on its own line, ![what it shows](path), becomes a captioned figure and is embedded in the page; see am help image.
- A placeholder such as <host> is shown as text. Inside a sentence only text-level tags stay (b, i, kbd, sup, a, span, br, img ...), and tags that break the page (script, style, iframe ...) are shown as text too. Put raw markup in an html or svg fence and code in backticks.
- Any other fence language is a code block; \`\`\`ts src=path lines=18-30 quotes real code from a file; see am help code.
- research template: {sheet} puts a panel in the overview sheet at the top; {depth=1|2|3} sets a body panel's reading depth
  (1 = 5-minute path, 2 = 30 minutes, 3 = everything; default 2).
- [[term]] in the text links to a glossary entry (the definition shows on hover); [F1](#F1) links to a finding card.
- For the component list see am list; for one component's syntax see am help <component>.`;

const IMAGE_HELP = `Images: a screenshot, photo or render that already exists as a file

![What the picture shows](/absolute/path/to/screenshot.png)

- Put the image alone on its line; the alt text becomes its caption, so write what the picture shows (the STE check reads it).
- Use the absolute path. A relative path is read from the draft file's folder, or from the current folder when the draft comes from stdin. A space in the path is fine.
- PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, AVIF and SVG files up to 5 MB. The file is embedded in the page, which stays one file that opens offline.
- http(s) URLs and data: URIs are left as they are. A URL needs the network when the page is opened.
- The page keeps the path of each image. am patch embeds the image again from the file, or from the page when the file is gone.
- Images are for things a diagram cannot show, such as a real screen. Do not generate or invent images.`;

const CODE_HELP = `Code blocks: real code from a file, or code you type

\`\`\`ts src=server/routes.ts lines=18-30 hl=22
\`\`\`

\`\`\`ts title="limits.ts · sketch"
export const LIMIT = 50
\`\`\`

- A fence whose language is not a component is a code block. Each block gets a header and a Copy button.
- src= quotes a file: the CLI reads the lines, so you do not type them, and the code is the real code. Leave the block empty.
  The path is read from the current folder, and only files inside it are quoted. lines=18-30 (or lines=18) picks the lines; without it the whole file is quoted.
- The header shows path:lines, or title= when you set it. Write "sketch" in the title of code that does not exist yet.
- hl=22 or hl=20-22,25 highlights lines by their shown number. start=38 numbers a typed block from 38.
- A diff: a fence with the language diff holds a unified diff you paste, and the CLI draws it (see below).
- 10 to ${LONG_CODE_LINES} lines make the point best: a longer block gets a warning, and more than ${MAX_CODE_LINES} lines is an error.
- Files that hold keys by convention (.env, *.pem, id_rsa, .ssh/, .git/ …) and files with anything that looks like a key or a token are refused.
- The render lists every embedded file. The page keeps the path; am patch reads the file again, or keeps the page's copy when the file has moved.

Diff blocks: show a change

\`\`\`diff file=src/code.js
@@ -60,3 +60,3 @@
 export function parseCodeArgs(args) {
-  const attrs = parseAttrs(args);
+  const attrs = parseAttrs(args, { diff: true });
   const opts = {};
\`\`\`

- Paste the unified diff. Each line starts with + (added, green), - (removed, red) or a space (context); a line with nothing on it counts as context.
- @@ -60,3 +60,3 @@ starts a hunk: the CLI shows it as a thin row and numbers the lines from it, with two gutters, old and new. Without @@, start=N numbers from N; with neither, the block has no numbers.
- file= names the file in the header, and the language label comes from its extension. A +++ b/path line names it when file= is missing; title= wins over both.
- The header shows a stat after the title: +1 −1. Copy copies the diff as written.
- hl= uses new-side numbers and needs numbers (@@ or start=).
- diff --git, index, ---, +++ and "\\ No newline at end of file" lines are accepted and not drawn.
- Cut lines (a line with only ... or …) are an error: the gutter cannot know how many lines were skipped. Split the diff into two hunks, each with its own @@ header.
- A hunk whose line counts do not match its @@ header is a warning. src= is not supported for a diff yet: paste the diff.
- The limits are the same as for other code blocks: a warning above ${LONG_CODE_LINES} lines, an error above ${MAX_CODE_LINES}, and the key and token check.`;

const RAW_HELP = `LANG — embed as-is (escape hatch)

When the fence language is LANG, the content goes into the page unprocessed. Use it only when no component can show the content;
use theme variables for colors (such as var(--ink), var(--accent)) so the content stays readable across themes and light/dark modes.

Example:
\`\`\`LANG
<div style="color: var(--accent)">any content</div>
\`\`\``;

const VIDEO_FORMAT = `Video draft format (am video)

title: TCP three-way handshake
subtitle: Why three steps      # optional, subtitle on the title card
theme: blueprint               # blueprint: drawing style (auto picks it; follows the theme in am config) | shadcn: cards | 3b1b: dark
mode: light                    # light | dark (blueprint + dark is a dark-blue drawing)

> Title-card narration (optional; without it the title card stays for 2.4 seconds)

## Both ends are waiting
\`\`\`sequence
Client -> Server: SYN
Server -> Client: SYN-ACK
Client -> Server: ACK
\`\`\`
> The client sends SYN first to ask for a connection.
> [Server] replies with SYN-ACK.
> The client sends ACK, and the connection is open.

- "## " starts a scene; a scene holds components or Markdown (the picture), and lines that start with > are narration (one beat per line).
- When narration line N plays, step N of the picture appears: in flow / er / sequence / tree each source line is one step;
  timeline, limits, table rows, list items and paragraphs step item by item. With more steps than narration lines, the steps are spread across the lines;
  with more narration lines than steps, the extra first lines act as an opening and show nothing new.
- Write [name] in narration: the camera zooms in on the element with that name and highlights it, and the word turns yellow in the caption.
- Nodes / participants with the same name in adjacent scenes move smoothly from the old position to the new one (cross-scene morph).
- Voice-over: --voice auto (default: ElevenLabs if ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is set, otherwise system TTS) | elevenlabs | local | system | off.
  The system voice is picked for each line from the languages installed on the machine: macOS say takes the installed voice of
  the line's language (a Taiwan voice for Traditional Chinese), Linux takes the espeak-ng voice for it.
  A line whose language has no installed voice keeps its caption without narration, and the run says which language that was.
  Set the ElevenLabs voice with ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID and the model with ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID (default eleven_v4_turbo).
  local calls a local OpenAI-compatible speech service (POST /v1/audio/speech, returns 16-bit PCM WAV):
  AM_TTS_URL (required, service base URL), AM_TTS_MODEL, AM_TTS_VOICE (required when the service has no default),
  AM_TTS_API_KEY is sent as a Bearer token when set; AM_TTS_EXTRA holds model-specific parameters (a JSON object); AM_TTS_MODEL / AM_TTS_VOICE override the same fields in it,
  and am always sets input, response_format and stream. A line whose duration is clearly wrong is synthesized again,
  up to AM_TTS_ATTEMPTS times per line (default 3; set 1 to turn this off).
  Example: AM_TTS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 AM_TTS_MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice-4bit \
      AM_TTS_VOICE=vivian am video draft.md --voice local
- Output goes to ~/.answer-me-with-html/videos/. The player carries a chapter strip (a chip jumps into that scene), a
  speed button (0.5x to 2x) and an export button that saves the same video through the browser, without a terminal.
- --mp4 also saves a 1080p .mp4 next to the page (H.264 + AAC; needs ffmpeg; about 1.3 times the video length).
  --webm saves a 1080p .webm that the page encodes itself (VP9 + Opus; no ffmpeg; the time follows how much of the page moves).
  Both need Chrome and Node 22+; give both to save both. The export button needs a secure context (a local file or
  localhost): WebCodecs is not available to a page served over plain HTTP.`;

Usage:
  am patch <html-file> --panel <title> < new-panel.md
  am patch <html-file> --panel <title> --from new-panel.md
  am patch <html-file> --panel <title> -

- Reads the source draft from the hidden <textarea id="am-source"> in <html-file>.
- --panel matches a ## section's title, its letter ID, or "ID title".
- The new draft comes from stdin or from --from / a second file argument: it may include the ## heading or only the panel body.
- Renders again with the current renderer and overwrites the same HTML path; it writes no new timestamped file.
- Keeps the page's template, theme, light/dark mode and STE style (recorded on the page's root tag when it was made). Later config changes do not apply to patched pages; to change them add --theme / --mode / --style.
- If the panel is not found, or the page has no #am-source, the exit code is non-zero and the file is not changed.`;

The file name is the theme name: themes/notes.json is theme "notes" (lowercase letters, digits and -; not a built-in name).
Pick it like a built-in theme: theme: notes in the draft, --theme notes, or am config set theme notes. The draft does not change.

{
  "label": "Notes",
  "tokens": {
    "common": { "--radius": "6px", "--font-sans": "\\"IBM Plex Sans\\", \\"Noto Sans CJK SC\\"" },
    "light": { "--bg": "#f7f5ef", "--paper": "#fffdf8", "--ink": "#1f1d1a", ... },
    "dark": { "--bg": "#14130f", "--paper": "#1c1b17", "--ink": "#eeeae0", ... }
  },
  "css": "& .am-panel-head { letter-spacing: 0.01em; }",
  "video": { "tokens": { "light": { "--v-stage": "#fffdf8" } }, "css": "& .amv-title { font-weight: 500; }" }
}

- label: the name on the page's theme button: a string, or an object with ${languageIds().join(' / ')} strings.
- tokens: light and dark must each set every color: ${COLOR_TOKENS.join(' ')}.
  common holds values shared by both; --radius --shadow --bw --head-font --font-sans --font-mono are optional.
- Fonts: name installed fonts only; the default font stack is added as the fallback. No font files are embedded.
- css (optional): start every selector with &, which stands for the theme's root, so the rules apply only under this theme.
- video (optional): video-only variables (--v-stage, --v-title-font, --v-cap-fg, --v-cap-bg, --v-glow) and & css for am video.
- A page carries the built-in themes plus its own theme, so it opens anywhere; readers without your fonts see the fallback.
- A file with problems is skipped with a warning; am theme check <name|file.json> tells you why.

am theme check <name|file.json> [--no-open]
- Reports invalid colors, missing variables and contrast below WCAG AA in light and dark (text 4.5:1; status badges 3:1, warning below 4.5:1).
- Exits with 1 when there is an error. Without errors it renders two specimen pages (light, dark) with every component.`;
